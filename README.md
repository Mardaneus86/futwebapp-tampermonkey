FIFA 21's companion app for FIFA Ultimate Team, the FUT 21 Web App, is a website that let's you trade and manage your team on the go.

This TamperMonkey script is meant to enhance the FUT 21 Web App experience. You can install the script following the instructions below. Afterwards you will get a settings button on the bottom right of the web app, where you can enable every feature by itself. The script provides a certain degree of customization possibilities.

:warning: Using this script is at your own risk. EA might (temp-)ban you for altering parts of their Web App.

:bangbang: Do not request autobuyer features. Because they are considered to be cheating, it will not be added.

I started this project to learn about reverse engineering big Javascript codebases.

If you benefit from this project, you can buy me a beer :beers: :+1:

## Developing
Clone this repository and execute:

npm install
```

To start the bundling process and linting process, execute:
```
npm start
```

Make sure to enable `Allow access to file URLs` in `chrome://extensions/` for Tampermonkey, and add the following script snippet:
```
// ==UserScript==
// @name        FUT Enhancer
// @version     0.1
// @description
// @license     MIT
// @author      Tim Klingeleers
// @match       https://www.easports.com/fifa/ultimate-team/web-app/*

// @namespace   https://github.com/Mardaneus86

Remember to change the path after `@require` to the folder where you cloned the repository. It should point to the generated `fut-enhancer.user.js` in the `dist` folder.
